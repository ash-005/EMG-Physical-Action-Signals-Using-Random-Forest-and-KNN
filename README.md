# **Physical Action Classification Using EMG Signals**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on classifying physical actions into two categories, **Aggressive** and **Normal**, using **Electromyography (EMG) signals**. The dataset contains signals from four subjects performing 20 distinct physical actions, captured through electrodes placed on eight different muscles. Machine learning models are trained to analyze and classify these activities based on extracted features.

This project is developed as part of a study in **pattern recognition** and **human movement analysis** using machine learning techniques.
